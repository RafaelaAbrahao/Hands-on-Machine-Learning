    "### 1) **How would you define Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques enabling computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. Instead of following detailed instructions, ML systems learn from examples and past experiences to make decisions or predictions. ML involves creating models that identify patterns in data, generalize from them, and apply this knowledge to new data. These models are trained using historical datasets and can automate tasks, classify information, predict outcomes, or detect anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) **Can you name four types of problems where Machine Learning shines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning excels in solving problems such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex problems without algorithmic solutions**\n",
    "- **Building systems that adapt to unstable environments**\n",
    "- **Replacing large lists of manual rules**\n",
    "- **Assisting humans in learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) **What is a labeled training set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeled training set is a collection of data used to train machine learning models, where each example (or data point) is paired with the correct output (or label). These labels serve as the \"ground truth\" that the model learns to predict during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) **What are the two most common supervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common supervised tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regression**\n",
    "2. **Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) **Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Four common unsupervised tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering**\n",
    "2. **Visualization**\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) **What type of machine learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in many paths in an unknown terrain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning** is the most suitable algorithm for this task, as it allows the robot to learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) **What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering**: If you donâ€™t know how to define groups, clustering helps separate clients into similar groups based on patterns or similarities.\n",
    "- **Classification**: If you already know how to define the groups, classification assigns data points to predefined labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8) **Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning or an unsupervised learning problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on a dataset of emails alongside their labels (spam or not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9) **What is an online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An online learning system continues to learn from new data after being deployed in production. This is in contrast to a batch learning model, which stops learning after the initial training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10) **What is out-of-core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-core learning refers to algorithms that can handle large datasets that cannot fit into a computer's RAM. These algorithms divide the data into mini-batches and use online learning techniques to learn from them incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11) **What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance-based models**, such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, rely on similarity measures to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12) **What is the difference between a model's parameters and a learning algorithm's hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Parameters**: These are the internal variables of the model that are learned during training (e.g., weights in a neural network).\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters**: These are external configurations set before training (e.g., learning rate, number of layers in a neural network). They control the learning process and are tuned to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13) **What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based algorithms search for the optimal parameters of a model that best represent the underlying patterns in the training data. The most common strategy is **optimization**, where a cost function is minimized to reduce the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values. Predictions are made by applying the learned parameters to new input data (e.g., using learned coefficients in linear regression or weights in neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14) **Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Four main challenges in Machine Learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**\n",
    "2. **Model Underfitting**\n",
    "3. **Data Mismatch**\n",
    "4. **Noisy Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15) **If your model performs great on the training data but fails on the test data, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a case of **overfitting**, where the model memorizes noise or specific details in the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. Three possible solutions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**: Add penalties to the model to reduce complexity.\n",
    "2. **Add More Data**: Increase the size of the training dataset.\n",
    "3. **Simplify the Model**: Reduce the complexity of the model (e.g., fewer layers in a neural network).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16) **What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A test set is a portion of the dataset kept separate from the training data. It is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after training. The test set assesses the model's generalizability to unseen data, providing an estimate of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17) **What is the purpose of a validation set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters during training. It helps in selecting the best model configuration without touching the test set, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18) **What is the train-dev set? When do you use it, and how do you use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **train-dev set** is a subset of the training data separated after the initial train/validation/test split. It is used to diagnose specific issues in the model's performance, particularly when there is a mismatch between the training data and the validation/test data distributions. By evaluating the model on the train-dev set, you can determine whether performance issues stem from overfitting to the training data or from data distribution mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19) **What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning hyperparameters using the test set can lead to **overfitting to the test set**. This means the model may perform well on the test set but fail to generalize to new, unseen data in production, as the test set is no longer a reliable indicator of real-world performance."
