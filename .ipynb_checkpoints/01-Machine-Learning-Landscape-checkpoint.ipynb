    "# The Machine Learning Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning system is trained using data and algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. The goal is to create models that can generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Machine Learning?\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Types of Machine Learning Systems**  \n",
    "Machine learning algorithms can be classified according to the amount of supervision they get during training. There are **4 major types** of ML algorithms:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Supervised Learning**  \n",
    "With supervised learning, the training set we feed into the algorithm contains the targets/labels/desired predictions. Most supervised learning tasks fall under two umbrellas: **Classification** and **Regression**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predicting discrete values (e.g., is the email spam or not spam).  \n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicting continuous target values (e.g., predicting the price of houses in dollars).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some regression-based models are used for classification as well, such as **Logistic Regression**, which outputs a probability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular Supervised Learning Algorithms**:  \n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors  \n",
    "- Linear Regression  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- Decision Trees and Random Forests  \n",
    "- Artificial Neural Networks  \n",
    "- Naive Bayes  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**  \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the system tries to learn without a teacher by finding internal structure within the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning Tasks**:  \n",
    "- **Clustering**:  \n",
    "  - K-Means  \n",
    "  - DBSCAN  \n",
    "  - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis  \n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**:  \n",
    "  - One-Class SVM  \n",
    "  - Isolation Forest  \n",
    "  - Auto-encoders  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compressing data without losing too much information (e.g., merging highly correlated features).  \n",
    "  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  \n",

    "  - Kernel PCA  \n",
    "  - Local Linear Embedding (LLE)  \n",
    "- **Association Rule Learning**: Finding interesting relations between attributes.  \n",
    "  - Apriori  \n",
    "  - Eclat  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**  \n",
    "In semi-supervised learning, we have partially labeled data. The goal is to use unlabeled data around the labeled data as helpers to solve the task. Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Reinforcement Learning**  \n",
    "An agent observes the environment, selects an action, gets a reward, and updates its policy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Batch vs. Online ML Algorithms**  \n",
    "We can also categorize ML systems into **batch** or **online algorithms**, depending on whether the algorithm learns from an incoming stream of data or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Learning**:  \n",
    "  - The model is incapable of incremental learning.  \n",
    "  - It learns from all available data offline and is then deployed to produce predictions without feeding it new data points.  \n",
    "  - Also called **Offline Learning**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Online Learning**:  \n",
    "  - The model is trained incrementally by continuously feeding it data instances as they come, either individually or in small groups called mini-batches.  \n",
    "  - Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn on the fly.  \n",
    "  - **Challenges**:  \n",
    "    - Bad incoming data can damage the model.  \n",
    "    - Requires monitoring through performance metrics and anomaly detection to mitigate risks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instance-Based vs. Model-Based Learning**  \n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning algorithms is by how they generalize. There are two approaches:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance-Based Learning**:  \n",
    "  - Performs similarity-based comparisons.  \n",
    "  - A new data point is classified based on its similarity to the target group in the training set.  \n",
    "  - Requires a measure of similarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model-Based Learning**:  \n",
    "  - Builds a model for each class of data points and uses the model to classify new data points.  \n",
    "  - **Example**: Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Main Challenges of Machine Learning**  \n",
    "The two main things that can go wrong with a machine learning project are:  \n",
    "1. Collecting bad data.  \n",
    "2. Picking a bad learning algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Challenges**  \n",
    "1. **Data Quantity**:  \n",
    "   - Even for simple algorithms, thousands of examples are often required (e.g., recognizing cats/dogs in images).  \n",
    "   - A famous paper showed that many algorithms perform similarly when given enough data, suggesting companies should invest more in **data corpus engineering** than algorithm development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Representative Data**:  \n",
    "   - The training sample must be representative of the production data to generalize well.  \n",
    "   - **Sampling Noise**: Occurs when the training set is too small.  \n",
    "   - **Sampling Bias**: Occurs even with large samples if the sampling method is flawed (e.g., non-response bias).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poor Quality Data**:  \n",
    "   - Outliers, errors, and noise in the data make it harder for the algorithm to detect patterns.  \n",
    "   - **Data Cleaning Steps**:  \n",
    "     - Outlier detection and cleaning (remove or replace outliers).  \n",
    "     - Handling missing features (discard instances, fill with median/average, or predict missing values using an auxiliary model).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Irrelevant Features**:  \n",
    "   - Datasets often contain irrelevant features, which hinder learning.  \n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering** is critical:  \n",
    "     - **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most useful features.  \n",
    "     - **Feature Extraction**: Creating new features based on existing ones or gathering new data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overfitting**  \n",
    "- **Definition**: The model performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new data.  \n",
    "- **Causes**: Complex models (e.g., deep neural networks) may memorize noise or small datasets.  \n",
    "- **Solutions**:  \n",
    "  - Use a simpler model with fewer parameters.  \n",
    "  - Gather more training data.  \n",
    "  - Reduce noise in the training data (fix errors, remove outliers).  \n",
    "  - Apply **regularization** to constrain the model and prevent overfitting.  \n",
    "    - Example: In linear regression (`f(x) = ax + b`), control the degrees of freedom by limiting parameter ranges.  \n",
    "    - Regularization is controlled via **hyperparameters**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Underfitting**  \n",
    "- **Definition**: The model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the training data.  \n",
    "- **Solutions**:  \n",
    "  - Use a more powerful model with more parameters.  \n",
    "  - Improve feature engineering (feed better features to the algorithm).  \n",
    "  - Reduce regularization constraints on the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Testing & Validating**  \n",
    "To evaluate a model, we split the data into two sets: **training** and **testing**. We care about the **generalization error** (out-of-training error), as it reflects the model's performance in a production environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts**  \n",
    "1. **Overfitting Detection**:  \n",
    "   - If the **training error** is low but the **testing error** is high, the model is overfitting.  \n",
    "   - Common practice: Use **80%** of the data for training and **20%** for testing (adjust based on dataset size).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Set**:  \n",
    "   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters (e.g., regularization) on the test set can lead to overfitting.  \n",
    "   - A **validation set** is used for hyperparameter tuning.  \n",
    "   - After tuning, the model is trained on the full training set (including validation) and evaluated on the test set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**:  \n",
    "   - A computationally expensive but robust alternative to setting aside a large validation set.  \n",
    "   - Involves training the model **N times** (e.g., k-fold cross-validation).  \n",
    "   - Ensures the validation and test sets are representative of production data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Train-Dev Set**:  \n",
    "   - Helps diagnose whether poor performance is due to overfitting or data quality.  \n",
    "   - **Steps**:  \n",
    "     - Train the model and evaluate on both the **train-dev** and **validation** sets.  \n",
    "     - **Good on train-dev but bad on validation**: Data is not suitable for the task.  \n",
    "     - **Bad on both train-dev and validation**: Overfitting or poor algorithm/data quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model Assumptions**  \n",
    "- A model is a **simplified version** of observations, designed to discard noise and capture generalizable patterns.  \n",
    "- **Assumptions** guide what information to keep or discard.  \n",
    "  - Example: A linear model assumes the relationship between input and output is linear, with deviations being noise. "

    "### 1) **How would you define Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques enabling computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. Instead of following detailed instructions, ML systems learn from examples and past experiences to make decisions or predictions. ML involves creating models that identify patterns in data, generalize from them, and apply this knowledge to new data. These models are trained using historical datasets and can automate tasks, classify information, predict outcomes, or detect anomalies.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9) **What is an online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An online learning system continues to learn from new data after being deployed in production. This is in contrast to a batch learning model, which stops learning after the initial training process.\n",

    "### 10) **What is out-of-core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-core learning refers to algorithms that can handle large datasets that cannot fit into a computer's RAM. These algorithms divide the data into mini-batches and use online learning techniques to learn from them incrementally.\n",

    "### 12) **What is the difference between a model's parameters and a learning algorithm's hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Parameters**: These are the internal variables of the model that are learned during training (e.g., weights in a neural network).\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters**: These are external configurations set before training (e.g., learning rate, number of layers in a neural network). They control the learning process and are tuned to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13) **What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based algorithms search for the optimal parameters of a model that best represent the underlying patterns in the training data. The most common strategy is **optimization**, where a cost function is minimized to reduce the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values. Predictions are made by applying the learned parameters to new input data (e.g., using learned coefficients in linear regression or weights in neural networks).\n",

    "### 16) **What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A test set is a portion of the dataset kept separate from the training data. It is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after training. The test set assesses the model's generalizability to unseen data, providing an estimate of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "The **train-dev set** is a subset of the training data separated after the initial train/validation/test split. It is used to diagnose specific issues in the model's performance, particularly when there is a mismatch between the training data and the validation/test data distributions. By evaluating the model on the train-dev set, you can determine whether performance issues stem from overfitting to the training data or from data distribution mismatches.\n",
