    "1) **How would you define Machine Learning?** ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task. In other words, instead of following detailed instructions, machine learning systems are capable of 'learning' from examples and past experiences to make decisions or predictions. Machine learning involves the creation of models that can identify patterns in data, generalize from them, and apply this knowledge to make decisions or predictions about new data. These models are trained using historical datasets and, once trained, can be used to automate tasks, classify information, predict outcomes, or detect anomalies, among other applications.\n",

    "2) **Can you name four types of problems where it shines?** ML is great for solving problems such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex problems that do not have an algorithmic solution\n",

    "- Building systems that adapt to unstable environments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replacing large lists of manual rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helping humans learn\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **What is a labeled training set?** It's a type of training set that includes the desired outputs (or labels) for each example\n",

    "\n",
    "14) **Can you name 4 of the main challenges in machine learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "15) **If your model performs great on the training data but fails on the test data, What is happening? Can you name 3 possible solutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "16) **What is a test set? & Why you would want to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
